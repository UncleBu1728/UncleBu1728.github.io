[MATLAB Projects]

This is a chemical engineering project that applied the Monte Carlo method 
to simulate molecules bonding, diffusion and reaction.
Code is implemented mainly by myself using the optimized algorithm 
We came up with which speeds up the simulation 10 times faster than the original code.
The MATLAB code and memorandum is linked below.
